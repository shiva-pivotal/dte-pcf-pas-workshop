= Lab 2 - Scaling, Auto Scaling

[abstract]
--
Pivotal Cloudfoundry makes the work of performing operations actions, such as scaling, doing a zero-downtime deploy, and managing application health very easy.
In the next two labs we'll explore Pivotal Cloud Foundry operations.

== Scale Horizontally

=== Scale the Application Out

. Now let's increase the number of running application instances to 3.  :
+
----
> cf scale shiva-articulate -i 3
Scaling app shiva-articulate in org shiva-pcf-poc / space development as shreddy@pivotal.io...
OK

----
+
In reporting `OK`, the CLI is letting you know that the additional requested instances have been started, but they are not yet necessarily running.

. We can determine how many instances are actually running like this:

. Revisit the application route in the browser.
Refresh several times.
You should observe the instance index changing as you do so:

The aforementioned https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router] is applying a random routing algorithm to all of the application instances assigned to this route.
As an instance reaches the `running` state, its https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html#architecture[Diego] Cell registers that instance in the routing table assigned to its route by sending a message to Cloud Foundry's message bus.
All (Go)Router instances are subscribed to this channel and register the routes independently.
This makes for very dynamic and rapid reconfiguration!

=== Scale the Application In

. We can scale the application instances back down as easily as we scaled them up, using the same command structure:
+
----
> cf scale shiva-articulate -i 1
Scaling app shiva-articulate in org shiva-pcf-poc / space development as shreddy@pivotal.io...
OK

----

. Check the application status again:

As you can see, we're back down to only one instance running, and it is in fact the original index 0 that we started with.

. Confirm that by again revisiting the route in the browser and checking the instance index:

== Scale Vertically

=== Scale the Application Up 

. Now let's increase the memory of application to 2G.  :
+
----
> cf scale shiva-articulate -m 2G

This will cause the app to restart. Are you sure you want to scale shiva-articulate?> y

=== Questions

* How long does it take to scale up or out applications now?

== Auto Scaling

As you have seen it is pretty easy to scale up or down using the cf CLI or Apps Manager, but there are times when you would like the app to auto scale based on some pre-determined conditions. Let us walk through the steps where your application will take advantage of the Auto Scaler service.

. Navigate to https://apps.run.haas-234.pez.pivotal.io and Log in, if redirected to login screen. 
. After login, click on the 'Marketplace' link on the left hand menu option as shown in the image below:
+
image::../../Common/images/marketplace-link.png[]

. Click on App Autoscaler and you will see a screen similar to the one below. 
+ 
image::../../Common/images/autoscaler.png[]

. Click on 'Select this plan' and fill in the following details: give a unique name in the 'Instance Name' field. The Add to Space will be auto-populated with the 'workshop' space. Choose your articulate application from the 'Bind to App' dropdown. Click on 'Add' to create an instance of App autoscaler and bind it to your app.
+ 
image::../../Common/images/add-autoscaler.png[]

. After the auto scaler service is successfully created and bound to your app, you would be taken to the following service screen:
+ 
image::../../Common/images/autoscaler-service-page.png[]

. Click on the App Autoscaler service and you will go into the details page. Click on the 'Manage' link as shown below:
+ 
image::../../Common/images/manage-autoscaler.png[]

. This will open the Autoscaler dashboard. Click on 'Instance Limits' edit link and enter 2 for Minimum and 5 for Maximum. Hit Save.
+ 
image::../../Common/images/edit-autoscaler.png[]

. Click on the toggle button to Enable Autoscaler for your articulate app. 
+ 
image::../../Common/images/autoscaler-enabled.png[]

. Going back to App Manager and clicking on your articulate app, you will notice that within 30 odd seconds or less, your app will get automatically auto-scaled to two instances.
